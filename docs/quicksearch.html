Here staker account for ST and beneficiary account for branded token is assumed as member reserve address. Following are the steps which are performed in this script: Select the member company for which we want to do stake and mint. Ask amount to be staked in ST and the passphrase of the member reserve using prompts. Call stake and mint util for doing the actual transactions on contracts. ref: module:tools/stake_and_mint/util Methods &lt;inner&gt; describeChain(chainType, web3Provider) Describe chain details. Parameters: Name Type Description chainType string Type of chain web3Provider string url of web3 provider. &lt;inner&gt; describeMember() Describe Member details. &lt;inner&gt; toDisplayST(num) convert simple token to display text.

Stake and mint is called in two variations: For branded token: module:tools/stake_and_mint/for_branded_token For simple token prime: module:tools/stake_and_mint/for_st_prime This utility has common functionality which is required for both these variations. Following are the steps which are performed in here: Staker address approves openSTValue contract address for toStakeAmount. We first check the current allowance and go for approval only when the current allowance and toStakeAmount are different. Staker address calls stake method of openSTValue contract. In the transaction receipt, we asset for StakingIntentDeclared event. Wait for openSTUtility contract to give StakingIntentConfirmed event. Proceed to next step if _stakingIntentHash in the event matches the same got in StakingIntentDeclared. Staker address calls processStaking of openSTValue contract. Staker address calls processMinting of openSTUtility contract. Staker address calls claim of utilityTokenInterface contract.
