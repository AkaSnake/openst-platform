## OpenST Platform development installation steps

Document has steps to configure platform in development environment. For further implementation details, please refer [API documentation][api-docs].

## Prerequisite installations 

* Install node version >= 7
* Install geth version >= 1.7.2

## Setup openST Platform

####Terminal 1

* Install node modules required for platform and restful APIs implementation

```bash
  > npm install
```

* Start the openST platform setup. Setup script will create "openst-setup" folder in your $HOME folder. Setup folder contains:

1. openst-geth-value - Acts as ethereum MainNet for development/test environment. Chain runs on POW consensus algorithm.
2. openst-geth-utility - Acts as openST side chain network for development/test environment. Chain runs on POA consensus algorithm.  
3. bin - folder contains multiple executables for platform chains and services
4. logs - folder contains logs generated by executables in bin folder
5. openst_env_vars.sh - Environment variables required for platform

```bash
  > node tools/setup/index.js
```

* Load platform environment variables  

```bash
  > source $HOME/openst-setup/openst_env_vars.sh
```

* Start all platform services in background (i.e. geth nodes and intercoms processes). We keep checking if all required services are up and running and publish alert messages if any service goes down. You can also run these services individually as well.   
```bash
  > node tools/setup/start_services.js
```

####Terminal 2

* Load platform environment variables  

```bash
  > source $HOME/openst-setup/openst_env_vars.sh
```

* Start the Branded Token registration and write the registration details in config file (branded_tokens.json in platform setup folder) for later use. For each new branded token please provide the following command line arguments:
1. Name - branded token name
2. Symbol - branded token symbol
3. Conversion Rate - branded token to OST conversion rate, 1 OST = x branded tokens

```bash
  > node tools/setup/branded_token/register.js "ACME Coin" "ACME" 10
```

* Stake OST and mint branded tokens on utility chain. Please provide the following command line arguments:
1. uuid - Get the branded token UUID from $HOME/openst-setup/branded_tokens.json
2. amountInWeis - The OST amount in Weis to stake
```bash
  > source $HOME/openst-setup/openst_env_vars.sh
  > node tools/setup/branded_token/mint.js [[uuid]] [[amountInWeis]]
```

####Terminal 1

* Stop the start_services.js script
